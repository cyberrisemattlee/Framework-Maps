# CyberRise Framework Mapping Project

 

The **CyberRise Framework Mapping Project** bridges the gap between cybersecurity frameworks and the real-world products or services that help implement them.

 

Our current focus is on mapping the **Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls v8** — all 153 safeguards — to vendor solutions in a consistent, transparent way.

 

## Purpose

 

Security frameworks tell you *what* needs to be done. We help you understand *which* products and services can help you do it, and *how* they align.

 

This project:

 

- Uses a **common vendor questionnaire** to gather standardized information

- Maps vendor capabilities to safeguards using clear categories:

  - `Doesn't Map`

  - `Facilitates`

  - `Full / Partial`

  - `Governance / Administrative`

  - `Validates`

- Provides a foundation for comparing vendors and identifying coverage gaps

 

## How It Works

 

1. **Vendors Answer** 

   Vendors respond to targeted, safeguard-specific questions (e.g., *"Does your product or service help maintain an inventory of assets?"*).

 

2. **Categorization** 

   Responses are mapped to one or more categories to reflect the type and extent of support provided.

 

3. **Mapping Output** 

   Results show exactly where a vendor’s solution fits within the framework — making security planning and vendor selection easier.

 

## Benefits

 

- **For Security Teams:** Quickly identify which safeguards are covered, find gaps, and reduce overlap.

- **For Vendors:** Clearly communicate how your product supports widely recognized frameworks.
